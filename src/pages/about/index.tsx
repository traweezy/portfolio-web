      My name is Tyler Schumacher, I am a full stack web developer, with over 6
      years of experience. Iâ€™ve worked for primarily for large financial
      institutions and fintech companies creating both public facing web
      application and internal tooling, while keep working on side projects on
      my own time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I focus on working with creating UI&apos;s that look beautiful and
      UX&apos;s patterns that make sense, while working with realtime data. Also
      creating server side code that is scalable and powerful.
